## Ipico Server ##

This is more of a client than a server right now.
It connects to an Ipico reader and listens for data.
This data can be a chip crossing the mat or the trigger button.

Chip times are displayed on screen along with chip id, time, and net time.
Trigger times are also displayed on the screen, you can easily see a list of trigger times and you can also create a trigger time by clicking an on-screen button.

All data that is read in from a reader can then be exported to a file.
This file should look exactly like the file stores on the flash drive plugged into the reader. Trigger times created by the on-screen button are not stored in this export file.
